            <h1> Game Design Project </h1>
            <p>This is an extremely fun and engaging class project I ever had. I took this technical writing class for the purpose of developing my professional skills in research, design, and communication of technical information. The class was giving a scenario that you were tasked to create a game in a company. Start with choosing and interviewing your team members and creating contract and policies. We have initialized a game with a brainstorm, researching and designing prototype, testing, and redesign. Finally, we came up with a game manual and made a presentation to the audience like a real a game release. It was really challenging that we wrote documents such as memos, proposals, progress and research reports and instruction manuals in a variety of professional report format. </p>
            <p>We need to created and presented a board game product within 3 months with game manual, instruction, and prototype. Experience in all aspects of game development through research game mechanics and theory, design storyline, and characters by using Publish, Adobe, set up a strategic goal and target audiences, Testing and iterating 3 levels before the final presentation. Writing technical documents includes memos, proposals, reports and manuals. As a PM of four people team, I managed project scope, plan, schedule, conducted requirements gathering and analysis, project communications, reported progress weekly and prepared collaborative documents for milestones.
