			<h1> U.S Baby Name </h1>
				<p>This is the first article as my journey on technical blog. The mean purpose is to start my data analytics career and practice my data visualization skills. It really makes my life embracing more fresh and breeze air because web design seems open a new world to me. This unique way creates a way for me to start my own interests of design which corporate with the modern technology. Like this article, using JavaScript to draw some interactive chart gives you lot of fun because you could click and play with it and it amuse you while delivery responsive useful information. </p>
				<p>This topic sounds very interesting to me since lots of friends having baby recently, and a good name normal be regard as giving lots of bless and wishes to the baby. So let’s dig into the deep to find out what exactly are the most popular U.S baby name.
                    And how does the baby name change and relevant with the time changes.
 </p>
			<h2> Different charts show facts about U.S baby name</h2>
				<p>There are three different, unique ways to explain the baby name data, let’s take a look.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1. How many boys and girls are born each year? </li>
					<li>2. Name diversity since 1880 </li>
					<li>3. Most popular name over time </li>
				</ul>
             <h3> Boys and girls are born each year</h3>
                <p> It was really interesting to find out the trend of the baby name of boys and girls are pretty similar. It looks like more boys given born than the girls since 1980. The time around 1914 and 1939 are the two big booming period for the new born baby. This indicates the World War I and World War II are highly possible will be main factors to influence the baby born rate. In addition, after the World War II, more babies coming and until 1960, the second-high peak of baby born period appears. In the other hand, the great recession during 1930 drop down the born rate but get recovered in the late 1930s. </p>
                <p> (The X axis are the time span label from 1980 to 2013. Sorry it was looks a mess since the chart type I choose can only do something like this. However, I am working on the change of another chart API, just need time to make some improvement.) </p>

     <h3> Name diversity since 1880 </h3>
                <p> We all know the baby are increasing by the time goes as the last chart shows, but will this make influence of the diversity of the name? Will more and more names be being used? Now, you can find the answer by looking at this chart. It clearly demonstrates the diversity name trend is rising each year. It was noticeable that in the past 10 years, the rate has decline for not really a certain reason, but we would like to wait to see the future trend. As we could see in the history period from 1910s to 1930s, the trend inclined as well, but it increased rapidly after the great recession gone.  </p>

    <h3> Most popular girls name over time </h3>
                <p> From this pie chart we have a general idea that the winner name last for several decades and will be replaced by another name in the next period of time. So basically it winning trend are in a very consistent pattern that every popular name will only be last about a certain period and comes next to another new popular name. Just as the girls name chart, the name Mary last 67 years in a row and finally replaced by Linda (this chart was spanned clockwise direction from 1980 to 2013.) Another fact we know is the name Mary is the name last longest of the most popular name since 1980, which is 67 years.   </p>

                <p> At the end, I feel using interactive chart to show data fact is a really effective and direct way to tell some stories. I want to continue this kind of works and demonstrate more data story. Even some of the chart seems not really works great to show the complete information, I will keep working on it and learn more useful technical skills to improve my data story. </p>
